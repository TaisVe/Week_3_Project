## Problem & Hypotheses

Questions you want to answer (maybe divided by different topics). Each question should include a conclusion written in a markdown cell.

## Methodology

Describe the methodology you are using, explaining the steps upi took for data cleaning, analysis, etc.

## Conclusions

What did we find after cleaning and analyzing the data?

## Further Questions

Further analysis we would like to do
- What are the most common flavor profiles/descriptions for the top grapes
- Analyze the quality of the top grapes (acidity, sweetness, pH, etc.)
- Look for reviews that have more bottles of wine in common
   - Possible solution: web scrape Vivino to get more wine options
